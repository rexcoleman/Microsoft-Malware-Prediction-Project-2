# Microsoft Malware Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to perform a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling on the Microsoft Malware Prediction dataset. The goal is to identify significant patterns and build robust predictive models for malware detection.

Here is how to distinguish between the notebooks based on their purposes in the comprehensive EDA approach:

00_initial_analysis.ipynb
Purpose: Initial Data Understanding and Integration

Tasks:
Examine basic properties like the number of features, records, types of variables, and initial missing data assessment.
Perform initial data loading and sampling.
Generate and print summary statistics for the train and test datasets.
Perform correlation analysis to understand feature relationships.
Suggest initial imputation strategies based on the summary statistics and correlation analysis.
01_data_exploration.ipynb
Purpose: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Tasks:
Univariate Analysis: Analyze the distribution of each variable including central tendency, variance, and outliers.
Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis: Explore relationships between features and the target variable (HasDetections).
Time Series Exploration: Analyze time-related features to identify trends and seasonal effects.
Visualize data distributions, relationships, and patterns using various plots and charts.
02_data_cleaning.ipynb
Purpose: Data Cleaning

Tasks:
Handle missing values using initial imputation strategies.
Correct noise and errors in the data.
Remove duplicates, especially concerning the unique MachineIdentifier.
Save the cleaned data for further analysis.
02a_iterative_cleaning.ipynb
Purpose: Iterative Data Cleaning and Validation

Tasks:
Refine imputation strategies (e.g., using KNN imputation for numeric columns).
Validate the imputation by performing post-imputation checks to ensure no missing values remain.
Conduct cross-validation to ensure model performance is not degraded by imputation.
Iterate on imputation strategies as needed based on new insights or data.
Update the config/imputation_strategies.yaml file with refined imputation strategies.
Comprehensive EDA Approach Implementation
Initial Data Understanding and Integration (00_initial_analysis.ipynb)

Examine basic properties, perform initial analysis, and suggest imputation strategies.
Exploratory Data Analysis (01_data_exploration.ipynb)

Conduct univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis, including time series exploration and visualization.
Data Cleaning (02_data_cleaning.ipynb)

Handle missing values, correct noise, and remove duplicates based on initial imputation strategies.
Iterative Data Cleaning and Validation (02a_iterative_cleaning.ipynb)

Refine and validate imputation strategies, ensuring data quality and updating the config as necessary.








## Data Understanding and Initial Analysis

### Objective
To gain a preliminary understanding of the dataset, identify any issues with data quality, and suggest strategies for handling missing values.

### Configuration and Data Loading
- **Configuration Files**: Configuration files for paths, feature metadata, and other settings were loaded successfully.
- **Data Loading**: A subset of the training and test datasets (100,000 rows each) was loaded for initial analysis.

### Summary Statistics
- **Count and Unique Values**: Understanding the number of observations and unique entries for categorical features.
- **Top Frequent Values**: Identifying the most common values in categorical features.
- **Statistical Measures**: Mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartile values for numerical features.
- **Missing Values**: The number and percentage of missing values for each feature.

#### Key Findings
- **Uniqueness**: Features like `MachineIdentifier` have unique values for each record, confirming the uniqueness of each entry.
- **Categorical Features**: Features like `ProductName` and `EngineVersion` have a limited set of unique values, indicating potential for feature encoding.
- **Missing Values**: Numerical features like `Census_IsAlwaysOnAlwaysConnectedCapable` and `Wdft_IsGamer` have missing values that need to be addressed.

### Correlation Analysis
- **Correlation Matrix**: A correlation matrix was generated to identify relationships between features and the target variable (`HasDetections`).
- **Multicollinearity**: Identifying any multicollinearity issues which might need to be addressed in further analysis.

### Imputation Strategies
Based on the summary statistics and correlation analysis, imputation strategies were suggested and implemented for handling missing values. The strategies include using mean, median, and mode imputation for different features based on their type and importance.
